HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b>

<em>HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b> tags can be nested</em>

Hmmm <tag attr = "value"> contents </tag>

<br>
I am going to learn to love <a href="www.wc3.org/html">HTML</a>
<br>
<br>
This website is <a href="udacity.com">my favorite</a>
<br>
<br>
<img src="url" alt ="text"> 
<br>
<br>
alt is "required"
its for broken requests
for the blind
It's a void tag so it doesn't need an ending tag
<br><br>
You may be wondering why anchor tags use the href attribute while img tags use the src attribute. And you may become frustrated when (not if) you make the mistake of using one when you really need the other. Because when you make this mistake, your HTML will not work.
<br>
<br>
in fact, you may have already forgotten how to add links to HTML. That's fine. Unless you're writing HTML all the time, details like these aren't worth remembering. A Google search for "adding links in html" will always get you your answer.
<br><br><br>
br is a void tag
<br><br><br>

p is paragraph tag, it is not a void tag
<p> contents </p>

<p>Hello everyone! </p><p>We're using two lines now!</p>
Why are there both br and p?  
<br>
Extra white space turns gets truncated
<br>
br is inline with text
text "<br>" text
<br>
but p creates a box around the text or block elements
<br>
b, em, img are inline
p element is the only block element so far
<p>In the previous video Steve explained the distinction between inline and block elements. It's not essential that you fully understand the distinction at this point.

What he said about block elements creating "invisible boxes" will be important, but you will learn more about this in the next lesson.

In the next video you will have your first encounter with container elements: elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside of them. The purpose of these elements will not be clear yet, but in the next lesson you will see how these elements can be used to create web pages with complex structures.</p>

span is inline
<br>
div is block

<span class ="foo">oh myyyy
  <div class ="bar"></div>.bla bla

<p>That's right! a, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements while div, p, and form are block elements.</p>  
<p>We now recommend using <a href="http://scratchpad.io/" target="_blank">**scratchpad.io**</a> instead of the HTML playground Steve refers to</p>

  <p> <h1><b>SUMMARY</b></h1></p>
<p>Thinking about what you've learned
First, recall the two main topics covered in this lesson.

Overview of the Internet: You were shown the big-picture view of how the internet works and were introduced to terms like servers, browsers, the internet, and HTTP.
<br><br>
  Introduction to HTML: You were introduced to HTML tags (like b,p, em, <b></b>, <p>, and <em></em>) and saw how even though these tags aren't visible to users of a web page, they still carry meaning that is meaningful to web browsers.
<br><br>
These topics were covered quickly and it's okay if you forget a lot of the details. But there are a few points which you should keep with you.
<br><br>
What to take away from this lesson.
<br><br>
The five most important things to take from this lesson are the following:
<br><br>
<h2>1 - What a Web Page is</h2>
<br><br>
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
<br><br>
2 - How Coding Works
<br><br>
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
<br><br>
I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
<br><br>
look like this:
<br><br>
I'm learning to code!
<br><br>
3 - Computers are Stupid
<br><br>
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
<br><br>
For example, if you forget to close a b <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. </b>This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.
<br><br>
4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything
<br><br>
There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
<br><br>
5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary
<br><br>
You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
<br><br>
Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (<p> p for example) and a closing tag, (</p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the br <br> tag).
<br><br>
Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br><br>
Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <a href="www.udacity.com"> a href ="udacity.com" p </a></p>
 <br><br> 

<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-rqydYSxtHRlBrcDVaWWd4XzQ&authuser=0">IMG WITH DOC TYPES</a>
These tags specify type of html docs
doctype html 
html
head - meta data javascript css
body tag
end all these tags

<p><h1>Important Concepts</h1>
<br><br>
How the Web Works
The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. This video does a good job of explaining.
<br><br>
HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". This video gives a good overview.
<br><br>
Tags and Elements
HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. This video explains the distinction well.
<br><br>
Why Computers are Stupid
Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
